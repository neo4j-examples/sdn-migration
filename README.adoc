= From SDN/OGM to Reactive SDN and beyond

== Target audience

If you are a developer working on a
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/5.4.x/reference/html/#reference[Spring Data Neo4j (5) / OGM (SDN/OGM in short)] application
and want to upgrade to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#reference[latest Spring Data Neo4j],
this migration repository is for you.

== Application

The application maps movies and actors from the built-in https://neo4j.com/developer/example-data/#built-in-examples[Neo4j movie dataset].

== Structure

The tip of each of the following branches define the desired state of the application for the corresponding migration step.
Feel free to browse the code in each of these branches to see the code changes that have been made.

[NOTE]
====
If you are only interested in the high-level changes that such a migration entails,
feel free to skip the rest of this documentation and read link:./migration.adoc[this] instead.

 - the "first step" branch, a.k.a. https://github.com/neo4j-examples/sdn-migration/tree/step1_sdn-ogm_imperative[`step1_sdn-ogm_imperative`],
contains the initial SDN/OGM application.

 - the "second step" branch, a.k.a. https://github.com/neo4j-examples/sdn-migration/tree/step2_sdn_imperative[`step2_sdn_imperative`], illustrates
the upgrade from a typical Spring Data Neo4j / OGM application to the latest Spring Data Neo4j, _without_ reactive support. Most of the existing
APIs are mapped one-to-one. This is the first recommended step to follow when you start a migration.

- The default branch, a.k.a. https://github.com/neo4j-examples/sdn-migration[`main`], includes the final state of the project.
The project uses, in that case, the latest Spring Data Neo4j version and relies
on its https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming[reactive programming] support.
